I'm not sure I completely follow what you're saying. Are you saying the IPCC are recommending net emission goals _only_. Further, that extracting what our gross emissions can be is a very complicated modelling problem?

If that is the case (and that would certianly explain not being able to find this number!), we can presumably calculcate observed gross and net emissions. Is the 5 $Gt \space \ce{CO2}e$ that observed difference.
